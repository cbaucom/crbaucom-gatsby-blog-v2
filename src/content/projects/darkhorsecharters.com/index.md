Dark Horse Charters offers fishing charters in and around Newburyport, Massachusetts. George and the FV Dark Horse team needed a website to display their charter information and allow customers to request to book a charter through a form. It's built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

It scores pretty well on Google's Lighthouse Audit, too!
